## How to register to the System

### User registration

The user registration mechanism provides a form that allows new users to register themselves on the system. It can be reached by clicking the &quot;Sign in&quot; link if you do not have an account on the login page. In order to register, the user must fill out the fields which are marked required and click the &quot;OK&quot; button. The following (Fig4) shows a filled-out version of the registration form.

**First name field**

This is where the user must enter his/her first name (for example &quot;Atwine&quot;).

**Last name field**

This is where the user must enter his/her last name (for example &quot;Nickson&quot;).

**Phone**

This number reveals the phone number of the user account that will be created.

**Password field**

This is where the user must enter a desired password (for example &quot;T-1000&quot;). The password must be at least three characters long. This field is case sensitive, in other words &quot;t-1000&quot; is not the same as &quot;T-1000&quot;.

Submit button

This button allows the user to submit the registration form. Once the button is clicked, the system will attempt to register the user.

**Successful registration**

If all fields have been filled out correctly, the &quot;Sign Up&quot; button is clicked and the system is able to register the new user account, the user will be redirected to the login page to enter the right details.
